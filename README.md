# PyHelper
This is a VS code extension that uses AI to help people program with NumPy, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and other ML/AI libraries. The goal of using this extension is not to give you answers, but to help you learn and explain the usage and parameters of different functions without having to exit your IDE. 

## Documenting the development Process
This section will be documenting the development process, as this is my first VS Code extension!

1. File explanations:

-- .vscode -> This folder contains files that allows you to launch another version of VS Code to test the extension in 

-- node_modules -> contains packages from node and dependencies

-- test -> contains tests to test our code

-- .eslint.config.mjs -> not sure what eslint is

-- gitignores -> ignore any files in git

-- extension.js -> where the extensions code will be
