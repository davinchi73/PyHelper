# PyHelper
This is a VS code extension that uses AI to help people program with NumPy, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and other ML/AI libraries. The goal of using this extension is not to give you answers, but to help you learn and explain the usage and parameters of different functions without having to exit your IDE.
